# SpeedTest
A small python script that I created when I was having issues with my ISP.  This script I ran to keep a eye on my download 
speed from the ISP.  I was activating it using crontab and logging the rsults so that I could use it as proof with the 
ISP to get a discount on the cost due to the degraded service that I was getting.

30Mbs down to 5Mbs downloads speeds for 20% of the day got me 20% discount off my ISP bill for 3 months
